GardaBooking is an app that the users can book their stay around Lake Garda.

Users can either choose "Lejligheder, Sommerhuse or Camping" that are stored from a firebase database. And that is where we retrive every "product" from.

I used flutter to make this app.

## Appendix


first thing i did was make the project in flutter.
Then i made a new firebase project and then i used the flutterfire because it only took seconds before the App ID's were set up.

After the Firebase project was up and running, i made sure to add the dependencies in my pubspec.yaml.

All calls from the database can be found in the projects repository folder.
